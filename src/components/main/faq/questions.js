    question: "How does the 14-day free trial work?",
    answer:
      "It’s simple. After you have registered in Pics.io, you are automatically given a 14-day free trial period. No credit card or any other personal information is required to get access to the free trial period. | During this time you have unlimited access to all Pics.io features and you can fully explore its capabilities. After this period is over, you can pick a convenient billing plan.",
